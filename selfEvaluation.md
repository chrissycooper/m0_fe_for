# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?
I feel much much more confident than I have before after working through all of those exercises!
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
I'm lucky to have also had some exposure to for statements in the past, and these exercises really helped me solidify and expand my understanding of the concepts. It's the end of the day, so I had some resistance whenever I was asked to solve something that required research or testing. But that struggle was productive. I was able to gently push myself to just try it out, and once I got rolling it was easier than I anticipated. I feel pretty proud of myself that I was able to guide myself to try even though some part of me wanted to stop, and that I was able to solve the challenges even though I'm pretty sleepy!

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
Right now, I feel confident in my abilities. I definitely want to review my notes in the morning before the day starts.

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

I don't have questions at the moment. I'm sure I will soon, and I'll talk through it with my small group or write about what I think the answer might be.
